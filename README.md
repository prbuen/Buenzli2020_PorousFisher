# Buenzli2020_PorousFisher
Nondimensionalised Porous-Fisher model applied to tissue engineering pore infilling, associated with Buenzli et al. (2020) Cell proliferation and migration explain pore bridging dynamics in 3D printed scaffolds of different pore size.

Set model parameters and mode of action in porousfisher_driver.m then run in MATLAB.

Running with show_plots = 1 produces the following figure:
![Pore Bridging](https://github.com/prbuen/Buenzli2020_PorousFisher/blob/master/porousfisher-plots.png)

Running with show_plots = 0 calculates time to bridge the pore:
    Tbridge = 4.0295
